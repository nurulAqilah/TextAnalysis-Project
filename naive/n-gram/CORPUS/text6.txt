This hotel is in a newly remodeled industrial building. The hotel is very nicely developed with interesting furnishings and decor. An in-house cafe serves quality simple meals for lunch and dinner. Everything is first rate. There is a gym but no pool. The location is couple of miles from downtown but close to a couple of malls and major hotels. It is easy to get around with the Grab ride app. The breakfast is great and staff is very helpful
