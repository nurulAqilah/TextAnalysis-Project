Stayed in an apartment type room. Bathroom was filthy. Toilet had brown stains - obviously never cleaned. Sink had a crust of dirt and grime under rim. Only two small size, thread bare towels provided which were far from white. Room never cleaned properly. Fridge had mould inside. Stayed there for six days. Didn't eat breakfast even though paid for as I dread to think what state the kitchen might be if the rooms are so dirty. Didn't use the swimming pool as also dirty. Had to use general loo by swimming pool once as reception toilet was out of use. It was absolutely filthy
