Poor customer service at check in/out counter. Totally mess. Not welcoming or appreciate the guest.
The room not clean. The worst is the toilet. So dirty..seriously... The size of the toilet room is small too. While the food.. the breakfast range is so little option.. In summary.. we are quite shock with the price that we paid and the service that we get. Totally not worth it. It might you last last last option to stay here
