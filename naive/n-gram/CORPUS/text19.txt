Stayed for 1 night, I must say that itâ€™s really rare to find a hotel like Rosa Hotel in the heart of Melaka. The place is really unique and everything is designed with a lot of effort and practicality in thoughts for their guest. Their rooms are well equipped with nice armchair with throw nicely design pillow and super comfortable bed. The staff is friendly and helpful. Will definitely be staying here in the near future
