This newly built hotel is in the style of an abandoned warehouse. Very funky and stylish. Modern fittings and very comfortable. Breakfast was in the atrium and reasonable. The Gym on the roof is ok, but needs more heavy weights and toilets!

They plan an extension which will add a much needed pool.

The bar is good and food was fine.

My only complaint is the AC was never cold enough in the high humidity
