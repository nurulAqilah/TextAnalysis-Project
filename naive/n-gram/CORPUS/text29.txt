I booked this place for a quick long weekend trip with my family. The only review of this place
made it seemed like this place is not bad but I think they can improve a lot on their
cleanliness. I only had problems with how dusty some furnitures were. We had a car, so
traveling around was not a problem.  The good thing about this place is the staffs are very
helpful and airconditions work well and are very cooling. The place is very cheap too.

If you are not a clean freak like me, you'll find this place acceptable
