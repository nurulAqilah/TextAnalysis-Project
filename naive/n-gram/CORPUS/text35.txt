I was supposed to stay here for a week but ended up staying for just 1 day because I had enough. The room is dirty, the shower is bad, the staff is unprofessional, and what made me leave is that I found a cricket and a cockroach in my room. Why can't they just clean the room for the guests? Extremely uncaring. I will never come here again
