Really didn't enjoy our stay here. The rooms were very smelly (cigarette smoke), and very
basic. We were not given towels, or a bed sheet.

The bathrooms are equally as terrible, with no toilet roll, and they weren't cleaned throughout
our stay in Melaka.

The staff weren't particularly friendly or helpful.

In addition, I don't think the location is that great - it took maybe 10 minutes to walk to the
centre of town.

If I were to return to Melaka, I would stay somewhere else closer to the town. There are some
lovely guesthouses in Jonker Street for the same value.
