Located in the heart of Malacca city centre, the hotel simply has the amazing wow factors at each and every corner of the building. The staffs were extremely friendly and helpful with welcoming gesture and of course indirectly encouraging them for another stay.

Working as a journalist in the Malaysian National News Agency (Bernama) with hectic and tiring schedules, the atmosphere, hospitality and the quality of service had just turned my retreat trip into a worth one.

I simply loved their courtyard, never had seen one like this anywhere before. Brilliant idea, I would say.

Oh yeah, I got to share on the food too. Their Asian cuisines are so tempting especially Asam Pedas Ayam, seriously delicious.

Definitely one of the best to recommend for others

Stayed for 1 night, I must say that itâ€™s really rare to find a hotel like Rosa Hotel in the heart of Melaka. The place is really unique and everything is designed with a lot of effort and practicality in thoughts for their guest. Their rooms are well equipped with nice armchair with throw nicely design pillow and super comfortable bed. The staff is friendly and helpful. Will definitely be staying here in the near future
