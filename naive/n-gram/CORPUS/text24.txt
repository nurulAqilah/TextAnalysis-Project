This hotel has no lift ...the parking attendant was very rude and we have to pay RM5 for
parking privately owned by one Indian lady. Hotel ground floor is a coffee shop. Hotel room
bed board was dusty with torn bed and dirty looking sheet .  Location is good . Walking distant
within 10 min to Jonkers Street
