If you want a hotel that is faraway from the action of Melaka, dark and dingy, has stained carpeting and sheets then this is the place for you. After looking at the hotel website and other people's reviews I had good hopes for this place. When I arrived I was really surprised at the dismal appearance of the hotel. If you come to Melaka stay at one of the larger or botique hotels closer to the historical attractions. It is worth it to stay at a hotel that is cleaner and has better management then to be cheap and come here. I stayed long enough to check out my room, the bathroom and get on the computer to find another hotel
