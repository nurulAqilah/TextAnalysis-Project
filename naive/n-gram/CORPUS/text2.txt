We enjoyed a wonderful 5 night stay in this stylish, boutique hotel.
The location is good & is around a 10 to 15 minute walk to the centre or you can easily get a 'Grab' which are plentiful & cheap.
The hotel is like a New York warehouse conversion - very stylish with lots of attention to detail.
It has a very relaxed, chilled vibe to it. We stayed in a deluxe room & it was spacious with a comfortable bed & was well kitted out.
Housekeeping was excellent - the room was spotlessly clean & was cleaned each day by the time we returned from breakfast. Breakfast was super.
I prefer a light breakfast so was delighted with the range of non cooked options (muesli, bran flakes, chia seeds etc) & lovely touches like fresh rosemary & lemon in the chilled water. (Cooked options are available too).
There is a lovely cafe & we had lunch & dinner there & the food was very good.
There is also a great little gym on the rooftop which is well equipped.
The staff were friendly & attentive across the hotel, right from arrival & being greeted by the smiling security man.
They made us feel like they really cared that our stay was a memorable one with them.
I have stayed at stacks of hotels throughout SE Asia & Rosa definitely ranks as one of my very favourites.
Thank you for making our stay such a great one
