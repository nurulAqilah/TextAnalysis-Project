This hotel stands out from every other hotel in Malacca. It definitely has the wow factor. Beautiful design, huge rooms, great attention to detail and lovely helpful staff. I stayed here for 3nights and didn’t want to leave the hotel. The courtyard is beautiful, especially when lit up at night. Breakfast is great as is the cafe for lunch and dinner.
I’m so glad I chose this hotel, it has been wonderfu
